        <h1>It's Humanity's Moral Obligation to Recycle</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <h3>Thesis: It is necessary to recycle</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It is necessary to preserve the environment</li>
            <li>If it is necessary to preserve the environment, then it is necessary to acknowledge one’s ecological citizenship</li>
            <li>If it is necessary to acknowledge one’s ecological citizenship, then it is necessary to recycle</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is necessary to recycle. (Inferred from 1, 2, and 3)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Section 1</h3>
        <p>In this section, I will defend the claim that it’s necessary to preserve the environment (premise 1) by pointing out that environmental preservation is essential for human stability. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objection to Premise 1: The preservation of humanity’s well-being is of greater value than the preservation of the environment’s well-being.</li>
            <li>My Response: Humans depend on natural resources to aid in their well-being, therefore if the environment’s well-being is in jeopardy, so is humanity’s.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Another Objection to Premise 1: It costs too much to preserve the environment while simultaneously keeping up with consumer demands.</li>
            <li>My Response: If the welfare of the environment isn’t maintained, then there would be less products on the market, which would create a greater demand and higher prices of consumer goods.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Section 2</h3>
        <p>In this section, I will defend the claim that if it is necessary to preserve the environment, then it is necessary to acknowledge one’s ecological citizenship (premise 2) by pointing out that people neglect the environment when they fail to preserve it. It’s permissible to say that when one neglects the environment, one neglects their moral obligation as a citizen to prevent environmental destruction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objection to Premise 2: One can still be mindful of the environment without actively preserving it.</li>
            <li>My Response: One’s ecological citizenship does not rely on thoughtfulness, but action.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Another Objection to Premise 2: Ecological citizenship is only relevant to the society that causes environmental problems.</li>
            <li>My Response: Environmental problems don’t just affect a single society, but are part of a chain reaction that affects societies as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Section 3</h3>
        <p>In this section, I will defend the claim that if it’s necessary to acknowledge one’s ecological citizenship, then it’s necessary to recycle by arguing that it’s necessary to take responsibility of one’s ecological footprint through the act of recycling in order to sustain the environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objection to Premise 3: Not everything is recyclable, making it impossible to fulfill one’s ecological citizenship.</li>
            <li>My Response: Recycling is just one of many ways to reduce someone’s ecological footprint, (i.e. reducing other factors such as electricity usage).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I’ll recap my argument, and briefly clarify that all the claims in this paper are about what’s typically true. (There may be places that already use natural or harmless resources and therefore do not need to enforce recycling; but in the U.S., the majority of recyclable items are not biodegradable and can be harmful to the environment if they are not properly taken care of.)</p>





        <h2>It’s Humanity’s Moral Obligation to Recycle</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Most of us think that every tangible thing we possess is disposable. Many of us, however, don’t consider the ramifications that stem from improper disposal and how it impacts the planet. In this essay, I will make the claim that proper disposal through recycling is not only necessary for the environment’s sake but for the existence of humanity. My argument has the following structure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We ought to preserve the environment.</li>
            <li>If we ought to preserve the environment, the we ought to be good ecological citizens.</li>
            <li>Good ecological citizens recycle.</li>
            <li>Therefore, we ought to recycle. (1, 2, 3)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This argument is valid. This means that the conclusion must be true if all the premises are true. In section 1, I will defend my first premise; in section 2, I will defend my second premise; and in section 3, I will defend my third premise. Throughout this essay, I will propose and respond to possible objections.</p>
        <h4>We ought to preserve the environment</h4>
        <p>I would first like to phrase my initial argument with a question: Why ought we preserve the environment? The more we disregard preservation, the more we pay the price for long term effects on a global scale. One may propose the objection against my first premise by claiming that the preservation of humanity’s well-being is of greater value than the preservation of the environment’s well-being. This argument, however, is false. The well-being of humanity and the environment are directly correlated. One study found that even though people only represent “just 0.01% of all living things, humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals and half of plants,” (Carrington).  As humans decrease the number of species, they are also decreasing the number of natural resources accessible and vital to humanity’s own well-being. The accessibility of environmental resources impacts the economy, climate and health of the planet and those living on it.</p>
        <p>Since humans depend on natural resources to aid in their well-being, therefore if the environment’s stability is in jeopardy, so is humanity’s. For example, if the welfare of the environment isn’t maintained, then there would be less products on the market, which would create an inequality of supply and demand of consumer goods, ultimately creating higher prices and inaccessible goods. This could contribute to medicinal, food, and other health related factors.</p>
        <p>So far, I’ve discussed why environmental preservation is necessary for the good of humanity. Next, I will discuss that if we ought to preserve the environment, then we ought to be good ecological citizens as well.</p>

        <h4>If we ought to preserve the environment, then we ought to be good ecological citizens</h4>
        <p>Why should humans take on the responsibility of conserving the environment if they are not legally obligated to? It can be argued that one can still be mindful of the environment without actively preserving it. To this statement, it is important define the roles and responsibilities of a citizen and how they connect to ecological citizenship. According to the Merriam Webster Dictionary, the legal definition of citizenship can be defined as “the quality of an individual's behavior as a citizen,” (“Citizenship”). By living in a society, one is expected to contribute by means such as obeying the law or paying taxes. A citizen’s quality and value to their society is rooted in their involvement.</p>
        <p>Though people aren’t forced to partake in any environmental roles, if one lives in a community (including environmental), they should uphold their moral duties as participants to maintain it. That being said, included in one’s “status of citizenship,” it is up to the individual to take responsibility in reducing their own ecological footprint, a measurement of the demands made by a person on global natural resources, (Hayden). This concept is otherwise known as “ecological citizenship.” This entails a citizen to be environmentally consciousness in order to reduce any potential harm they may cause to the environment overall (Revkin).</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of human impact on the environment, one must be aware of the relationship between organisms and their environments. In other words, we cannot preserve the environment if we are not good ecological citizens. Furthermore, it’s permissible to say that when one neglects the environment as part of their more duty, one then becomes a contributing factor to environmental destruction. One’s ecological citizenship does not rely solely on thoughtfulness, but selfless action. Environmental deterioration is a chain reaction across all ecosystems. One country’s inability to take care of their environment could impact the status and well-being of another country’s well sought after environment. Even if ecological citizenship is asymmetrical, ecosystems are all interconnected and people are morally obligated to preserve theirs, if not for their sake, for the sake of another’s ("Ecological Citizenship: The Basis of a Sustainable Society").</p>

        <h4>Good ecological citizens recycle</h4>
        <p>Good citizens are not perfect citizens, but they are good through their means of intent and action. In this section, I will defend the claim that good ecological citizens recycle by arguing that good ecological citizens take responsibility of their ecological footprint through the act of recycling in order to sustain the environment. As I’ve previously mentioned, a good citizen not only has good intentions, but good behavior. A good citizen actively seeks to participate in the improvement of their society.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not everything is recyclable. This brings up the question of whether or not one’s ecological citizenship is even attainable when so many products are expendable and indestructible. Even though this may be true, recycling is just one of many ways to reduce someone’s ecological footprint. A good ecological citizen will recognize when they should use other methods of conservation and preservation to compensate for recycling or a lack thereof. Solar, wind, and water power are just a few types of renewable energy humans can work to preserve. For example, a good ecological citizen could recognize the excessive amount of water they use on a monthly basis and try to cut down on their showering time, (Revkin).</p>
        <p>To summarize, good ecological citizens are mindful. When such citizens are mindful and recycle, they minimize pollution and inherently improve implications for future generations and environments.</p>
